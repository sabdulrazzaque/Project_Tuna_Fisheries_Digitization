**Getting Started**

**Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python libraries:
- pandas

Place your dataset at the specified path in the file_path variable in the script (dashboard.py). Update the file_path if necessary.

**Run the dashboard:**

**Dataset Requirements**
The dashboard requires an Excel file with the following columns:

- Year: Year associated with the records.
- Total sheets: Number of sheets for each record.
If the dataset doesnâ€™t meet these requirements, the dashboard falls back to a sample dataset for demonstration purposes.

- Explore KPIs: View automatically updated metrics.
- Visualize Data: Navigate through the following charts:
- Scatter Plot
- Histogram
- Bar Chart
- Line Chart
- Box Plot
- Heatmap
- Cumulative Trend
- Reset Filters: Reset filters for a broader dataset view.

**Troubleshooting**
No Data Available: If no data appears:
Adjust the filters to include more data.
Verify the dataset for completeness and format requirements.
Dataset Issues: If the file path is incorrect or the file is missing, the dashboard uses a default sample dataset.
